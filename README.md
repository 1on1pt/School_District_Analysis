# School_District_Analysis
School district analysis for Py City Schools.
## Overview of the School District Analysis
Maria, who is the Chief Data Scientist for the Py City School District, has been tasked with preparing all standardized test data for analysis and using this information to report on performance trends and patterns.  She has asked for my assistance in analyzing funding and standardized test score data so that this information can be presented to the school board and superintendent.

After the initial report was completed, the school board discovered that there was evidence of academic dishonesty where the Thomas High School ninth grade math and reading scores were altered.  The school board has asked that the math and reading scores at Thomas High School be replaced with NaNs while keeping the rest of the report intact.

This presentation will include a disussion on how removing the Thomas High School ninth grade math and reading scores from the original report affected the overall analysis.  The final school district analysis will ultimately assist the school board and superintendent in their budgeting process and setting priorities.

**This comprehensive school district analysis included the following metrics:**
* The District Summary
* The School Summary
* The Top 5 Performing Schools
* The Bottom 5 Performing Schools
* The Average Math Grade for Each Grade Level from Each School
* The Average Reading Grade for Each Grade Level from Each School
* The Scores by School Spending Per Student, by School Size, and by School Type

### Resources
